# AI Resume Tailoring Setup Guide

## OpenAI API Key Configuration

To use the AI resume tailoring features, you need to set up your OpenAI API key.

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### Step 2: Configure the API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project:

```bash
# .env file
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Important:** 
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`
- Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your real API key

### Step 3: Restart the Development Server

After adding the API key, restart your development server:

```bash
npm start
```
